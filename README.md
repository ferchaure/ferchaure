# Hi, I'm Fer

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Despegar.com and finishing my PhD at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires.

I love researching and working with Machine Learning, as well as automating repetitive tasks and solving complex problems with simple solutions.

### Current Research Interests:

- Code Performance (Rust is looking promising )
- Causal machine learning.
- Game theory
- Reinforcement learning
