## About Me
I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Despegar (the leading travel company in LATAM) and a PhD candidate at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Buenos Aires. As an engineer, I have developed methods and analytical tools for neuroscience research.
My passion lies in exploring the intersections of machine learning, automation, and problem-solving.


## ðŸŒ± Current Research Interests
- Code Performance Optimization (maybe Rust is a nice solution or Julia)
- Causal Machine Learning
- Game Theory
- Reinforcement Learning
