# Hi, I'm Fer 👋

## About Me

I’m a Data Scientist at MercadoLibre (MELI) by day and a tech-lead on scientific projects by night. I hold a PhD in Engineering from the University of Buenos Aires, where I developed analytical tools and methods for neuroscience research. I enjoy living at the intersection of math, machine learning, automation, and problem-solving.
 
## Research Interests
- Agent-based simulation
- Data science methods for temporal and trajectory modeling
- Complex Systems
- Low level computing and operating systems

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss data science, machine learning, or any of my research interests!
