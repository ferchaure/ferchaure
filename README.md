# Hi, I'm Fer 👋

## About Me

I completed my PhD in Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires, doing research in neuroscience, and I still do some scientific work on the side. My day job is as a Senior Data Scientist at Despegar (the top travel company in LATAM). As an engineer, I've developed methods and analytical tools for neuroscience research. I love exploring the intersections of math, machine learning, automation, and problem-solving.
