# Hi, I'm Fer 👋

## About Me

I completed my PhD in Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires, where I focused on developing analytical tools and methods for neuroscience research. These days, I’m a Data Scientist by day and a scientist by night—still doing some academic work on the side. I enjoy living at the intersection of math, machine learning, automation, and problem-solving.
